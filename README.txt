This repository includes script files to generate a discrete fracture network(DFN), run flow and particle transport simulation, and identify dead-end fractures using graph theory. 

To generate a DFN and run flow and transport, modify the file paths in the files 'input_path.txt' and 'notes.txt'. Then, invoke the bash file 'note.txt'. For this, the software dfnWorks should be installed in your machine. 

Once the simulation is done, run the MATLAB script 'find_deadEnd.m' to identify dead-end fractures.
